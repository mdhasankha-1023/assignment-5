                    <p class="text-justify text-slate-300 text-xl mt-8">
                        DOM is a programming interface for Html documents. It's full form is Document Object Model
                        (DOM).
                        Document refers to HTML file, Object refers to all Html elements and tags. Modal refers to a
                        specific structure known as a dom tree. JavaScript can easily manipulate and access Html
                        elements
                        with use Dom. When the html document is loaded in a browser, the html document is converted to a
                        DOM
                        tree. All Html element or object is expressed as a node in Dom tree. That is, all html object in
                        the
                        Dom tree is called a node.

                    <h2 class="text-3xl text-cyan-400 font-medium">2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM ? Name
                        the
                        DOM methods ?</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify text-xl text-slate-300 mt-8">DOM can be used to select HTML elements in five
                        ways. Using tag name class name, id name and using query selector method.
                        The DOM methods are:
                        1. getElementByTagName() method.
                        2. getElementsByClassName() method.
                        3. getElementById() method.
                        4. querySelector() method.
                        5. querySelectorAll() method.

                    <h2 class="text-3xl text-cyan-400 font-medium">3.What is event bubble?</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify text-xl text-slate-300 mt-8">Event bubbling refers to the propagation of an
                        event
                        from a child element to its parent and eventually to the root element of the document. When an
                        event
                        is triggered on a nested element, it will also be triggered on all of its parent elements. This
                        means that event handlers on a parent element can handle events that originated on a child
                        element.

                        <span class="text-cyan-200	"> {For example, if you have a button inside a div, and both the
                            button
                            and div have click event handlers, clicking the button will trigger the click event for the
                            button and then bubble up to the div, triggering its click event as well. Another example is
                            when a user clicks a link inside a paragraph, the click event will bubble up to the
                            paragraph
                            and then to the body and document elements}</span>.

                        it?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="text-justify text-xl text-slate-300 mt-8">A callback function is a function that is passed
                        as
                        an argument to another function and is called by that function. It is a way of achieving
                        asynchronous programming, where the program can continue to execute while the callback function
                        is
                        performing its task. Callback functions are used to handle events, handle errors, or to pass
                        data
                        between functions. They are commonly used in event-driven programming, where the program needs
                        to
                        respond to user input or other events. They are also used in web development, where they are
                        used to
                        handle requests and responses to the server. Callback functions are a powerful tool for creating
                        flexible and efficient programs.
